title: My Pencils Are Sharp Enough
---

We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. It's important to me that you're happy.

This is your world. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.

You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.

Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. It all happens automatically. This is a fantastic little painting.
